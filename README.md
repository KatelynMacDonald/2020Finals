# 2020Finals
Semester 1 Computer Science Finals for Junior Year
I am putting everything in their tonight to grade
Can you look at the individual projects before you grade them and see if I have everything. If I do you can go ahead and grade it for the extra credit. If I don't can you send it back to me so I can fix it
